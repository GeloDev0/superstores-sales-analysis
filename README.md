# ðŸ“Š Excel Sales Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ§  About this Project
This project is my beginner data analysis practice using Microsoft Excel. I used a sample dataset that contains sales, profit, category, region, and customer information. The goal is to explore the data, find patterns, and create a simple dashboard to show insights.

## ðŸªœ Steps I Did 

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Checked if all columns have correct data.
- Made sure the **Order Date** column is in a valid date format.
- Removed empty rows or wrong values.

### 2. Creating Pivot Tables
I created Pivot Tables to summarize the data:
- **Sales and Profit by Category** â€“ to see which product category sells the most.
- **Sales by Region** â€“ to know which region has the highest sales.
- **Profit by Years** â€“ to see how profit changes every month.
- **Top 5 Customers by Profit** â€“ to identify the top customers.
- **Top 5 Products by Profit** â€“ to identify the top products.
- **Profit by Ship Mode** â€“ to know which ship mode has the highest profit.

### 3. Creating Charts
I added charts to make the data easier to understand:
- Column Chart for **Sales and Profit by Category**
- Pie Chart for **Sales by Region**
- Line Chart for **Sales and Profit by Years**
- Bar Chart for **Top 5 Customers**
- Bar Chart for **Top 5 Orders**
- Bar Chart for **Profit by Ship Mode**
