# Excel Sales Data Analysis Project

## About this Project
This project is my beginner data analysis practice using Microsoft Excel. I used a sample dataset that contains sales, profit, category, region, and customer information. The goal is to explore the data, find patterns, and create a simple dashboard to show insights.
